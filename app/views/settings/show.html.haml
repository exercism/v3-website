            We recommend listing the pronouns you'd like people to use when referring to you.
            %strong In the example testimonial below, enter the pronouns you'd like us to show to your mentors and students.
            You can leave this blank, in which case we will not suggest any pronouns.

              did a great job.
              = f.text_field "pronouns[0]", placeholder: "e.g. They"
              thoroughly answered all my questions and
              = f.text_field "pronouns[2]", placeholder: "e.g. their"
              insight was great. Iâ€™d definitely recommend
              = f.text_field "pronouns[1]", placeholder: "e.g. them"
              to others!
