          C# is a modern, object-oriented language with lots of great features, such as type-inference and async/await. The tooling is excellent, and there is extensive, well-written documentation.

          %p C# is a multi-paradigm, statically-typed programming language with object-oriented, declarative, functional, generic, lazy, integrated querying features and type inference.
          %p Statically-typed means that identifiers have a type set at compile time--like those in Java, C++ or Haskell--instead of holding data of any type like those in Python, Ruby or JavaScript.
