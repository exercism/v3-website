  %h1 About Elixir

  %p
    Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the BEAM virtual machine used
    to implement the Erlang programming language. Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for
    building distributed, fault-tolerant applications.

  %p
    Elixir also provides productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time
    metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.
