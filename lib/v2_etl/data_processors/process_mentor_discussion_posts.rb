        # TODO: This currently doesn't cope if there are more than one
        # set of mentor discussions for the same solution.
        #
        # The solution I want to take is to copy all the posts to
        # each discussion. It's not ideal but it's the only sane way.
        #
        # So the following steps need to be taken:
        # 1. Remove any mentor discussions where there are no
        #    posts by that mentor (ie where they joined then left)
        # 2. Add an idx flag to discussions, and populate with an
        #    incrementing number for each discussion on the same solution.
        # 3. For each idx in the db (1..n), do the pass below but have
        #    the idx as a join condition.
        # x. Remove the idx flag from discussions

        # Create a v3 mentor_discussion_post
        # for each v2 discussion_post
